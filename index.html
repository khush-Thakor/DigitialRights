    <center><h1>Digital Rights and the First Amendment</h1>

        <p>&nbsp; When we investigate our ways of communication, traditionally we would think of a face-to-face conversation. However, as we evolve our ways of communication through ingenuity and technological advancements, normal lines of communication are being transformed to digital. Society is now reliant on instantaneous connection through social media platforms to receive and diffuse information. Having information being spread on platforms like social media, there are many issues that arise with the relaying of messages. Companies that run social media platforms should be able to control the information that is put on social media because they are support by the first amendment, difference between private and public forums, and laws like Section 230 for the protection of users and companies on this vast digital world. Even though many users use social media as a way of expressing their voice, and control of media on the online world can be dangerous, social media companies should have the right to control what is put on to their platform.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; As we know today that we have many social media platforms in which we tend to browse for information about various topics from celebrities to politics. Social media being such a wide platform with large number of users, the information put on can be exploited. Due to this fact many social media companies have decided to block or sort of censor information from sources in which they seem to be not appropriate for the users on social media. As a result, the sources that are being censored or being removed from social media have fired back in the name of the first amendment. Who is right in this case, the private social media companies or the users who invoke their first amendment? For a viable solution to this argument, we must first know what the first amendment is.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; The people of the United States have certain rights given by the constitution known as amendments. According to Congress.gov the First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances” (U.S. Const. art. I, § 1). The First Amendments gives US Citizens freedom of speech, religion, and peaceful assembly. In context with our issue the government cannot act to censor a citizen’s speech, this would be taking away their freedom of speech. Is it though the government that is restricting speech on social media? The question comes into play is social media a government platform? Many times, courts have established the fact that social media companies are not government actors and therefore should not need to protect the first amendment of users. One example being the court case of Prager University vs Google in which concluded that “YouTube is a private entity whose editorial decisions cannot be challenged under the First Amendment, because YouTube itself has First Amendment rights to manage its platform as it sees fit (Greene, 2022)”. In this case Prager University, which was not favoring the decision of YouTube to tagging videos of the channel as “mature content”, in which it sought to sue Google, the company that own YouTube, since YouTube violated the First Amendment  (Greene, 2022). The court ruled that YouTube is a private actor meaning that it not government affiliated, and government actors are responsible for upholding the First Amendment not private actors. Also telling that YouTube is a private platform that host speech for the public but that does not make it a government actor in which it is not bound to upholding the first amendment. Therefore, concluding that social media sites like YouTube., Facebook, Twitter, are not government actors therefore are not bound to behave on the constraints of the First Amendment. Although that in the case YouTube was labeled as a private forum, there have been many cases in which the first amendment is supported on social media by the differentiation of public vs private forums.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; As we saw above that since YouTube is private hosting network and it does not facilitate as a government forum, it is a private network and has the right to censor information on its forum. The implementation of the First Amendment also lies in the difference between private and public forums. On a public forum such as a government forum in which it is opened for public discourse, therefore a citizen’s speech in that would be protected under the First Amendment. There have been cases in which social media has been considered a public forum. One example would be the judgment of a “appellate court held that the official Twitter page operated by then President Donald Trump was a designated public forum (Pinkus 1).”  The President of the United States had a Twitter Page and had blocked some comments made on the post, but since the twitter page was operated by a government official, the commentors were on a public forum and their first amendment right was protected. Rather it had been a private individuals page then the page would be private forum in which censorship would be allowed (Pinkus 1). Even if the Presidents Twitter page is a public platform it was hosted on a private platform of Twitter and hence Twitter does have right to say to what is run on its page. This example of the Twitter goes to show that public forums may exist on social media if are operated by government actors thus must abide by the users first amendment, however this does not demolish the fact that social media companies are not run by government actors and therefore are private forums and have the right to control media on a private platform.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Circling back to the idea of the first amendment, citizens, in which U.S citizens cannot be censored by the government. The first amendment also gives the right to freedom of press, meaning that media sources like newspapers are allowed to publish any material without fear of government intervention in meaning that they can produce any material and may not be forced to write against their own will (Pinkus, 2021). This is where Section 230 comes into play where it established that social media sites have immunity to third part content such as user generated content. According to Brett M. Pinkus from UNT College of Law, “social media companies are broadly protected from responsibility for what users say while using their social media platforms.” Also giving the right to edit and censor any content that the social media companies feel as “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.” (Pinkus, 2021). With the law of Section 230 it has been established that Social Media sites are private and in which they can control information on the platform. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook also do indicate in the Terms and Conditions of using their service of their right to take down user content if found to be part of subjects like hate speech. Section 230 gives the right to social media companies to edit their own private forums and the immunity to the content that is posted by a user. Section 230 establishes the fact that social media companies can modify and censor information that is posted by the user based on also hate speech. Social media companies are allowed to take down user content on the base of hate speech or other topics of interest but how can this be decided, or can it be exploited?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Section 230 and the First Amendment give the right to social media companies to control the information that is put on to their forum and does grant immunity from user generated content but how can this be exploited. When it comes to the Internet and social media since they are such big platforms, they are open to be taken advantage of the grave amount of people who use the platforms. In many cases there is Hate Speech and misinformation that spreads on the platform. “First Amendment provides broad protection to offensive, repugnant and hateful expression (Nott & Peters, 2022).” The First Amendment protects hate speech from government censorship unless that speech incites or is likely to incite imminent lawless action (Nott & Peters, 2022). This goes to show that speech is protected by the first amendment but how does that an affect on social media and the speech of people in on social media? Some argue that tech giants will gain political power in which if they have control over media flow. “Entity like Facebook engages in censorship, individuals don’t get to participate in the marketplace of ideas and are not allowed the liberty to engage in individual self-fulfillment (Hudson)” Censorship of information can be dangerous to public and government, such in many third world countries like China or North Korea where the social media is monitored and modified by state and private corporations there have been grave dangers or exploitation of the people of the government. However though even if governments and private corporation can take advantage of censorship of the social media, countries like the USA have certain rights in place which may protect users on public forums and in public spaces. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; Social media censorship has taken a rise in the last decade due the fact that our society is now more reliant on a digital world of communication. Finding solution to this modern social issue is not easy due it is having many sides which are wrong and right in many ways. Many people believe that their speech on social media is protected due the first amendment, but social media companies also have rights to first amendment. Social media companies should and have the right to the first amendment and that being the freedom of press, in which the press, in this case being social media companies, have the right to publish information on their own will. The differentiation of public vs private forums also shows how the first amendment affects censorship online. Many critics believe that this right of social media platforms can be dangerous to democracy and may lead to corruption, supreme court case verdicts and laws like Section 230 stand today to protect social media companies right. Nevertheless, as we as society develop new tools and technology to improve communication many road bumps and issues will come along the way, and it should be our due diligence to resolve our issues and move forward for the common good.</p>
